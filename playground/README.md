# Playground

This directory contains a simple script that demonstrates how to use the MCP Fraxlend tools.

To run the script, you need to have Node.js and pnpm installed.

1.  Navigate to the `playground` directory:

```bash
cd playground
```

2.  Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3.  Run the script:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The script will call the `lend` tool and log the result to the console.
